# MEEP-Service


This is the repository for a service created as a test for my application at MEEP. You are seeing the root folder, where I'll add any documents and files later, if any.
You can find the actual code for the service, along with instructions on how to run it, in the meep-service-application folder.

The actual code is a service that retrieves data publically exposed by a MEEP endpoint and stores the latest version of it.
In case you are wondering, there are no pull requests or incremental commits because I was a bit pressed for time and it was not a requirement.
