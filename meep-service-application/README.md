# MEEP-Service


## What is this?

This is a service built as part of my application for MEEP.

## How to build?

You can compile the project by running a maven command that compiles the project, like:

> mvn clean install


## How to deploy?

Simply locate the jar generated by the compilation done in the previous step, and run it using java.
For example, if you are located in this directory:

> java -jar target/MEEP-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Maven will also generate another copy of this jar in your local .m2 repository


## IDE configuration

This project uses Lombok to reduce boilerplate code. You might need to install Lombok plugins in your IDE for the code to compile correctly. If you are still having problems, consider enabling Annotation Processing


## Database

This application uses an in-memory database, which means that when the application stops running the data will be lost.


A console for the in-memory database is automatically exposed on http://localhost:8080/h2-console 

You can check on the database visiting this page and logging in with the following parameters:

- jdbc-url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb 
- username: sa 
- password: 

You can find the data retrieved by the service in the Vehicle_entity table
